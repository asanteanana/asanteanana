Hi, I'm Nana. I specialize in privacy engineering, data protection, and compliance, bridging the gap between security and user trust.

My mission is to design robust privacy systems for the greater good of society.

I'm interested in AI for UX, as well as Explainable and Responsible AI.

- I’m currently learning more about privacy laws, LLMs, and tools for thought.
