Shalom. I'm Nana, a IT student at Lewis University studying Data Privacy and CS.

I'm currently interested to creating privacy-conscious AI solutions and ensuring the ethical use of data. My mission is to design robust privacy systems for the greater good of society.

My key interests are in Tools for Thought, AI in UX, Explainable and Responsible AI.


Please feel free to connect with me if you're interested in discussing privacy in the digital realm or exploring the ethical applications of AI. Let's work together to make the world a safer, smarter, and more responsible place.
